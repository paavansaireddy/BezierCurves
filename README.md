-> implemented using De Casteljau algorithm and a naive algorithm. 
-> after guilding your file executive by running ./BezierCurve command. 
-> A black screen popups and costruct the four pouints on the screen using mouse.
-> Then you will see a curve which is in grees constructed from the first point to the last pont. 
-> You will see a green curve if you have used the De Casteljau algorithm.
-> you will see a red curve if you have used the naive algorithm. 
-> you will see a yallow if you have used the both. This proves that the implementation of De Casteljau algorithm is correct.
